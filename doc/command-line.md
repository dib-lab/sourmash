# Using sourmash from the command line

From the command line, sourmash can be used to compute
[MinHash sketches][0] from DNA sequences, compare them to each other,
and plot the results; these sketches are saved into "signature files".
These signatures allow you to estimate sequence similarity quickly and
accurately in large collections, among other capabilities.

Please see the [mash software][1] and the
[mash paper (Ondov et al., 2016)][2] for background information on
how and why MinHash sketches work.

______

sourmash uses a subcommand syntax, so all commands start with
`sourmash` followed by a subcommand specifying the action to be
taken.

## An example

Grab three bacterial genomes from NCBI:
```
curl -L -O ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/refseq/bacteria/Escherichia_coli/reference/GCF_000005845.2_ASM584v2/GCF_000005845.2_ASM584v2_genomic.fna.gz
curl -L -O ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/refseq/bacteria/Salmonella_enterica/reference/GCF_000006945.1_ASM694v1/GCF_000006945.1_ASM694v1_genomic.fna.gz
curl -L -O ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/refseq/bacteria/Sphingobacteriaceae_bacterium_DW12/latest_assembly_versions/GCF_000783305.1_ASM78330v1/GCF_000783305.1_ASM78330v1_genomic.fna.gz
```
Compute signatures for each:
```
   sourmash compute *.fna.gz
```
This will produce three `.sig` files containing MinHash signatures at k=31.

Next, compare all the signatures to each other:
```
sourmash compare *.sig -o cmp
```
Finally, plot a dendrogram:
```
sourmash plot cmp
```
This will output two files, `cmp.dendro.png` and `cmp.matrix.png`,
containing a clustering & dendrogram of the sequences, as well as a
similarity matrix and heatmap.

## The `sourmash` command and its subcommands

To get a list of subcommands, run `sourmash` without any arguments.

There are five main subcommands: `compute`, `compare`, `plot`,
`search`, and `gather`.  See [the tutorial](tutorials.html) for a
walkthrough of these commands.

* `compute` creates signatures.
* `compare` compares signatures and builds a distance matrix.
* `plot` plots distance matrices created by `compare`.
* `search` finds matches to a query signature in a collection of signatures.
* `gather` finds non-overlapping matches to a metagenome in a collection of signatures.

There are also a number of commands that work with taxonomic
information; these are grouped under the `sourmash lca`
subcommand. See [the LCA tutorial](tutorials-lca.html) for a
walkthrough of these commands.

* `lca classify` classifies many signatures against an LCA database.
* `lca summarize` summarizes the content of a metagenome using an LCA database.
* `lca gather` finds non-overlapping matches to a metagenome in an LCA database.
* `lca index` creates a database for use with LCA subcommands.
* `lca rankinfo` summarizes the content of a database.
* `lca compare_csv` compares lineage spreadsheets, e.g. those output by `lca classify`.

Finally, there are a number of utility and information commands:

* `info` shows version and software information.
* `index` indexes many signatures using a Sequence Bloom Tree (SBT).
* `sbt_combine` combines multiple SBTs.
* `categorize` is an experimental command to categorize many signatures.
* `watch` is an experimental command to classify a stream of sequencing data.

### `sourmash compute`

The `compute` subcommand computes and saves signatures for
each sequence in one or more sequence files.  It takes as input FASTA
or FASTQ files, and these files can be uncompressed or compressed with
gzip or bzip2.  The output will be one or more JSON signature files
that can be used with `sourmash compare`.

Usage:
```
sourmash compute filename [ filename2 ... ]
```
Optional arguments:
```
--ksizes K1[,K2,K3] -- one or more k-mer sizes to use; default is 31
--force -- recompute existing signatures; convert non-DNA characters to N
--output -- save all the signatures to this file; can be '-' for stdout.
--track-abundance -- compute and save k-mer abundances.
--name-from-first -- name the signature based on the first sequence in the file
--singleton -- instead of computing a single signature for each input file,
               compute one for each sequence
--merged <name> -- compute a single signature for all of the input files,
                   naming it <name>
```
### `sourmash compare`


The `compare` subcommand compares one or more signature files
(created with `compute`) using estimated [Jaccard index][3].
  The default output
is a text display of a similarity matrix where each entry `[i, j]`
contains the estimated Jaccard index between input signature `i` and
input signature `j`.  The output matrix can be saved to a file
with `--output` and used with the `sourmash plot` subcommand (or loaded
with `numpy.load(...)`.  Using `--csv` will output a CSV file that can
be loaded into other languages than Python, such as R.

Usage:
```
sourmash compare file1.sig [ file2.sig ... ]
```

Options:
```
--output -- save the distance matrix to this file (as a numpy binary matrix)
--ksize -- do the comparisons at this k-mer size.
```

### `sourmash plot`

The `plot` subcommand produces two plots -- a dendrogram and a
dendrogram+matrix -- from a distance matrix computed by `sourmash compare
--output <matrix>`.  The default output is two PNG files.

Usage:
```
sourmash plot <matrix>
```

Options:
```
--pdf -- output PDF files.
--labels -- display the signature names (by default, the filenames) on the plot
--indices -- turn off index display on the plot.
--vmax -- maximum value (default 1.0) for heatmap.
--vmin -- minimum value (default 0.0) for heatmap.
--subsample=<N> -- plot a maximum of <N> samples, randomly chosen.
--subsample-seed=<seed> -- seed for pseudorandom number generator.
```

Example output:

### `sourmash search`

The `search` subcommand searches a collection of signatures or SBTs for
matches to the query signature.  It can search for matches with either
high [Jaccard similarity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaccard_index)
or containment; the default is to use Jaccard similarity, unless
`--containment` is specified.  `-o/--output` will create a CSV file
containing the matches.

`search` will load all of provided signatures into memory, which can
be slow and somewhat memory intensive for large collections.  You can
use `sourmash index` to create a Sequence Bloom Tree (SBT) that can
be quickly searched on disk; this is [the same format in which we provide
GenBank and other databases](databases.html).

Usage:
```
sourmash search query.sig [ list of signatures or SBTs ]
```

Example output:

```
49 matches; showing first 20:

### `sourmash gather`

The `gather` subcommand finds all non-overlapping matches to the
query.  This is specifically meant for metagenome and genome bin
analysis.  (See [Classifying Signatures](classifying-signatures.html)
for more information on the different approaches that can be used
here.)

If the input signature was computed with `--track-abundance`, output
will be abundance weighted (unless `--ignore-abundances` is
specified).  `-o/--output` will create a CSV file containing the
matches.

`gather`, like `search`, will load all of provided signatures into
memory.  You can use `sourmash index` to create a Sequence Bloom Tree
(SBT) that can be quickly searched on disk; this is
[the same format in which we provide GenBank and other databases](databases.html).

Usage:
```
sourmash gather query.sig [ list of signatures or SBTs ]
```

Example output:
```
overlap     p_query p_match

Note:

Use `sourmash gather` to classify a metagenome against a collection of
genomes with no (or incomplete) taxonomic information.  Use `sourmash
lca summarize` and `sourmash lca gather` to classify a metagenome
using a collection of genomes with taxonomic information.

## `sourmash lca` subcommands

These commands use LCA databases (created with `lca index`, below, or
prepared databases such as
[genbank-k31.lca.json.gz](databases.html)).

### `sourmash lca classify`

`sourmash lca classify` classifies one or more signatures using the given
list of LCA DBs. It is meant for classifying metagenome-assembled genome
bins (MAGs) and single-cell genomes (SAGs).

Usage:

```
sourmash lca --query query.sig [query2.sig ...] --db <lca db> [<lca db2> ...]
```

Example output:

```
ID,status,superkingdom,phylum,class,order,family,genus,species
"NC_009665.1 Shewanella baltica OS185, complete genome",found,Bacteria,Proteobacteria,Gammaproteobacteria,Alteromonadales,Shewanellaceae,Shewanella,Shewanella baltica
```

### `sourmash lca summarize`

`sourmash lca summarize` produces a Kraken-style summary of the
combined contents of the given query signatures.  It is meant for
exploring metagenomes and metagenome-assembled genome bins.

Usage:

```
sourmash lca summarize --query query.sig [query2.sig ...] 
    --db <lca db> [<lca db2> ...]
```

Example output:

```
100.0%   792   Bacteria;Proteobacteria;Gammaproteobacteria;Alteromonadales;Shewanellaceae;Shewanella;Shewanella baltica
100.0%   792   Bacteria;Proteobacteria;Gammaproteobacteria;Alteromonadales;Shewanellaceae;Shewanella
100.0%   792   Bacteria;Proteobacteria;Gammaproteobacteria;Alteromonadales;Shewanellaceae
100.0%   792   Bacteria;Proteobacteria;Gammaproteobacteria;Alteromonadales
100.0%   792   Bacteria;Proteobacteria;Gammaproteobacteria
100.0%   792   Bacteria;Proteobacteria
100.0%   792   Bacteria
```

### `sourmash lca gather`

The `sourmash lca gather` command finds all non-overlapping
matches to the query, similar to the `sourmash gather` command.  This
is specifically meant for metagenome and genome bin analysis.  (See
[Classifying Signatures](classifying-signatures.html) for more
information on the different approaches that can be used here.)

Usage:

```
sourmash lca gather query.sig [<lca database> ...]
```

Example output:

```
overlap     p_query p_match
---------   ------- --------
1.8 Mbp      14.6%    9.1%      Fusobacterium nucleatum
1.0 Mbp       7.8%   16.3%      Proteiniclasticum ruminis
1.0 Mbp       7.7%   25.9%      Haloferax volcanii
0.9 Mbp       7.4%   11.8%      Nostoc sp. PCC 7120
0.9 Mbp       7.0%    5.8%      Shewanella baltica
0.8 Mbp       6.0%    8.6%      Desulfovibrio vulgaris
0.6 Mbp       4.9%   12.6%      Thermus thermophilus
```

### `sourmash lca index`

The `sourmash lca index` command creates an LCA database from
a lineage spreadsheet and a collection of signatures.  This can be used
to create LCA databases from private collections of genomes, and can
also be used to create databases for e.g. subsets of GenBank.

See [the `sourmash lca` tutorial](tutorials-lca.html) and the blog
post
[Why are taxonomic assignments so different for Tara bins?](http://ivory.idyll.org/blog/2017-taxonomic-disagreements-in-tara-mags.html)
for some use cases.

If you are interested in preparing lineage spreadsheets from GenBank
genomes (or building off of NCBI taxonomies more generally), please
see
[the NCBI lineage repository](https://github.com/dib-lab/2018-ncbi-lineages).

### `sourmash lca rankinfo`

The `sourmash lca rankinfo` command displays k-mer specificity
information for one or more LCA databases.  See the blog post
[How specific are k-mers for taxonomic assignment of microbes, anyway?](http://ivory.idyll.org/blog/2017-how-specific-kmers.html) for example output.

### `sourmash lca compare_csv`

The `sourmash lca compare_csv` command compares two lineage
spreadsheets (such as those output by `sourmash lca classify` or taken
as input by `sourmash lca index`) and summarizes their
agreement/disagreement.  Please see the blog post
[Why are taxonomic assignments so different for Tara bins?](http://ivory.idyll.org/blog/2017-taxonomic-disagreements-in-tara-mags.html)
for an example use case.
